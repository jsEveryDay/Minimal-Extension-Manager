# Minimal-Extension-Manager
Simple on-off switch popup extension manager, built for performance and ~0 footprint

What you see is what you get.
Runs only when clicked, then it kills itself. No background activity. 20mb memory consumtion on click.

When an extension is activated the current tab is automatically reloaded, when an ext is deactivated nothing happens.

Scroll bar for infinite extensions count. Enjoy.
